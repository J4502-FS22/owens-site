<p>San Francisco and Oakland get a lot of love, as they should, but the South Bay Area, which encompasses fun cities like San Jose, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, and Mountain View, has plenty to offer too. Known for fantastic food, thriving communities, and just a smidge of tech companies, the South Bay is incredibly diverse in what you can do. Looking at aggregators will only get you so far, so here are some of the best hidden spots in the South Bay Area.</p>

<p>1021 Monterey Salinas HWY, Monterey, CA 93940</p>
